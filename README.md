#  Exam 70-535: Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions (replaces 70-534) 
Listing down some note and references which mgiht be helpful for this exam readiness.

Candidates for this exam define the appropriate cloud native, cloud migration, and hybrid cloud solutions to meet the required functional, operational, and deployment requirements through the solution lifecycle. Candidates should know the features and capabilities of Azure services to be able to identify tradeoffs and make decisions for designing public and hybrid cloud solutions.
